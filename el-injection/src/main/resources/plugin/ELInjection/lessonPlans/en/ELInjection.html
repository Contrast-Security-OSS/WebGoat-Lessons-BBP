 <p><b>Lesson Plan Title:</b> How to Perform Expression Language (EL) Injection </p>
</div>

<p><b>Concept / Topic To Teach:</b> </p>
<!-- Start Instructions -->
EL injection attacks represent a serious threat. EL Injection happens when attacker controlled data enters an EL interpreter. With EL implementations prior to 2.2, attacker can recover sensitive server side information available through implicit objects. This includes model objects, beans, session scope, application scope, etc. The EL 2.2 spec allows method invocation, which permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code within context of the application. This can manipulate application functionality, expose sensitive data, and branch out into system code access-- posing a risk of server compromise. The methods behind an attack are easy to learn and the damage caused can range from considerable to complete system compromise. Despite these risks, an incredible number of systems on the internet are susceptible to this form of attack.

Not only is it a threat easily instigated, it is also a threat that, with a little common-sense and forethought, can easily be prevented.<br>
<br>
It is always good practice to sanitize all input data, especially data that will used in OS command, scripts, and database queries, even if the threat of EL injection has been prevented in some other manner.<br>

The form below allows a user to view their credit card numbers. Try to inject an Expression Language string that results in all the credit card numbers being displayed. Try the user name of 'Smith'.
